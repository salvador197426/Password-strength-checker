# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

This is a simple **Password Strength Checker** built in Python.  
It allows users to input a password and evaluates its strength based on multiple conditions:
- Minimum length
- Presence of digits
- Uppercase and lowercase letters

The program provides **step-by-step feedback** and informs the user whether their password is weak, medium, or strong.  
This project was developed as part of a **Professional Development mini-project** for the module **S2-PFD200**.
